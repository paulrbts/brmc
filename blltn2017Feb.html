  <h2>Membership Cards</h2>
  <p>These have finally arrived and we shall have them with you as soon as we can. Thank you for your patience!</p>

  <h2>The Logbook 2016</h2>
    <p>The Logbook is an annual newsletter/magazine of some of the club&#39;s activities over the previous year. The new one can be viewed online <a target="blank" href="https://rawgit.com/paulrbts/brmc/master/The%20Logbook%202016.pdf">here</a>.</p>
    <p>If you have any feedback, or would like to contribute to the next Logbook (it&#39;s never too early and best written while the trip/event is recent!) please <a href="mailto:secretary@brmc-adventure.org.uk">let Paul know</a>.</p>

  <h2>Hut Meets</h2>
  <p>There are no planned hut meets for February as yet but, if you&#39;re free any weekend and would like to arrange a meet at the hut to make the most of the Welsh weather, please <a href="mailto:hut@brmc-adventure.org.uk">contact Mike</a> to book the hut.</p>
  <p>Feel free to put a &lsquo;Hut Meet Call&rsquo; post on the forum and Facebook to gather interest and if you&#39;d like the committee to e-mail out to the membership, let one of us know.
  </p>
  <p>Ginge has set the meets list for the year as follows (thanks Ginge):</p>

  <p>Historically, each weekend had a <em>Meets Leader</em> to be the main point of contact for the weekend and take responsibility for general arrangements, Saturday evening group meal and dealing with the financials (collecting hut fees <em>etc</em>.). If you&#39;d like to volunteer to be a <em>Meets Leader</em> for one of the weekends, please <a href="mailto:meets@brmc-adventure.org.uk">contact Ginge</a> in the first instance.</p>
  <p>Please put the dates in your diary – look forward to seeing you all there!</p>

  <h2>BMC Club Roadshows</h2>

  <p>The Roadshows will be replacing the Clubs Seminar for 2017 and will be taking place during February and March at four venues across the country to make them easier for more people to access.</p>
  <ul>

    <li><b>Saturday 25 February</b> YHA, London Lee Valley</li>
    <li><b>Saturday 11 March</b> Redpoint Climbing Centre, Worcester</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Wednesday 15 February</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Wall Calls</h2>
  <p>Can all &lsquo;Wall Calls&rsquo; be posted on the forum and Facebook. Some of our members are not on Facebook and only hear about it by word of mouth or via the forum.</p>
  <p>If you want to start up another regular Wall Call, please post it on both the forum <em>and</em> Facebook. Some club members aren&#39;t on Facebook and only hear about it by word of mouth or the forum.</p>
  <p>Current Wall Calls:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Redpoint, Worcester</b> Every Tuesday from 7pm&#151;please contact Dave Holland</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Anna Thompson is generally at Redpoint, Worcester on a Sunday morning for Yoga from 9am to 10am and has suggested a Wall Meet from 10am if anyone is interested. If you don&#39;t already have Anna&#39;s details, let us know and we will put you in touch.</p>
  <p>Paul and Kim are back climbing at Wolf Mountain, Wolverhampton a couple of times a week, though not on regular days. If you&#39;re passing and would like to meet for a climb, let one of them know.</p>
  <p>If you&#39;re passing Shrewsbury, &lsquo;Climbing the Walls&rsquo; opens at 10am on Wednesday 01 February 2017. Check out the website for further details: <a href="https://climbingthewalls.club">https://climbingthewalls.club</a></p>
  <p>We&#39;ve also been made aware of a new Bouldering Centre which opened in Solihull on 28 January 2017. They&#39;ve been in touch offering the club a half price climbing day (£4 per member, no registration fee). We just need to agree a date with them for members to go and play. We&#39;re proposing Wednesday 01 March 2017, instead of the pub meet. Please contact Kim if you&#39;d like to go and if you can do Wednesday 01 March 2017. Check out their website for further details: <a href="http://www.flashclimbing.co.uk">http://www.flashclimbing.co.uk</a></p>

  <h2>Committee Meet</h2>
  <p>The Committee had their first meet of the year on 19 January 2017. Many items were discussed and plans are afoot for the 50 years&#39; celebrations.</p>
  <p>The next Committee Meet will be Wednesday 22 February 2017.</p>
  <p>If you have anything you would like the Committee to discuss, please drop any of us a line. We&#39;re always keen to hear from the membership as to ideas, thoughts, concerns, feedback and suggestions. It&#39;s your club and it&#39;s up to the Committee to do the best we can for the membership.</p>

  <h2>Hut Sub-Committee</h2>
  <p>The Hut-Sub Committee is always looking for keen volunteers to help with ideas, marketing and general maintenance. Please <a href="mailto:hut@brmc-adventure.org.uk">contact Mike</a>, in the first instance, if you’d like to be involved.</p>
  <p>All going well, and thanks to the continued hard work and commitment of the Hut Sub-Committee, the hut will be finished in 2017 just in time for the 50th anniversary of the Club.</p>
