  When responding can you confirm:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Meat/vegetarian/any-other-requirements</li>
    <li>How many of you are coming (names please)</li>
    <li>If you&#39;re happy to camp at Eric&#39;s if there&#39;s not enough space in the Hut</li>
    <li>Whether you can help with food</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Thank you to Emma M for arranging the campsite and congratulations to Amanda for embarking on her first climb and also to Lauren and Alex for their first climbs.</p>
  <p>Thanks to everyone who made it!</p>

  <h3>Cornish Coast</h3>
  <p>Guy has put a post on Facebook asking if anyone is up for the Cornish Coast.
  Ken has suggested this is moved &lsquo;closer to home&rsquo; (Pembroke) as a good few people would rather not travel so far for a weekend.
