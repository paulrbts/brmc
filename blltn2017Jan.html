  <h2>AGM 2016 & Old Documents</h2>
  <p>The 2016 AGM was very well attended and the minutes will be available soon for those of you who were unable to attend. Congratulations to Pete Redfern for winning the photo competition with his last minute entry. Pete&#39;s photo has taken pride of place on the Facebook page and you will see it on the membership cards which will be ready in the new year.</p>
  <p>We were very lucky that some older members attended: Keith Lucas, Geoff Briscoe, Bob Reeve, Nigel Bunyan and Andy Spires. With them came not only a bundle of old documents from the 1970s through to the 1990s, but some amazing pictures also from that period. We can certainly learn a lot from that time, having looked at the Meets List, Newsletters and general activities the Club got up to back in the day.</p>
  <p>However, it is becoming apparent that there may be more old documents out there and for the Club&#39;s 50th Anniversary this year it would be great to collate them all.</p>
  <p>If anyone has any old Club documents they would be willing to pass on to the Committee or make us aware of, please let one of us know.</p>

  <h2>Hut Meets</h2>
  <p>There are no planned hut meets for January as yet, but if you&#39;re free any weekend and would like to arrange one, please contact Mike to book the hut.</p>
  <p>Feel free to put a &lsquo;Hut Meet Call&rsquo; post on <a href="http://www.brmc-adventure.org.uk/forums/viewforum.php?f=3&sid=95b7b97eb20619a7ad4fd1c2318f9140">the forum</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/brmc.adventure/">Facebook Group</a>.</p>

  <h2>Pub Meets</h2>
  <p>1st and 3rd Wednesdays of each month, at The Cross in Finstall from 8.30pm. Reminders will also be posted on the forum and Facebook. January's dates are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Wednesday 04 January</li>
    <li>Wednesday 18 January</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Pub Meet Talks</h2>
  <p>After Hilary Thornton&#39;s excellent talk about testing the human body on Mt Erebus last January, 2016 wasn&#39;t a great year for talks. We know some of you have been out on trips so get up there and tell us about it!</p>
  <p>We know some of you have been out on trips so get up there and tell us about it! We&#39;ve nominated Dave Holland for the first talk about his and Ken&#39;s Cogne trip in January. Paul and Kim can give a talk about their 5-day Winter Climbing course with Glenmore Lodge. Dates aren&#39;t fixed yet but we&#39;ll send them out when finalised.</p>

  <h2>Wall Calls</h2>
  <p>The only regular Wall Call is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Redpoint, Worcester</b> Every Tuesday from 7pm&#151;please contact Dave Holland</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Anna Thompson is generally at Redpoint, Worcester on a Sunday morning for Yoga from 9am to 10am and has suggested a Wall Meet from 10am if anyone is interested. If you don&#39;t already have Anna&#39;s details, let us know and we will put you in touch.</p>
  <p>Paul and Kim are back climbing at Wolf Mountain, Wolverhampton a couple of times a week, though not on regular days. If you&#39;re passing and would like to meet for a climb, let one of them know.</p>
  <p>Can all &lsquo;Wall Calls&rsquo; be posted on the forum and Facebook. Some of our members are not on Facebook and only hear about it by word of mouth or via the forum.</p>
  <p>If you want to start up another regular Wall Call, please post it on both the forum <em>and</em> Facebook. Some club members aren&#39;t on Facebook and only hear about it by word of mouth or the forum.</p>

  <h2>Committee Meet</h2>
  <p>The first meet of the new committee will be on 19 January 2017.</p>
  <p>If you have anything you would like the Committee to discuss, please drop any of us a line. We&#39;re always keen to hear from the membership as to ideas, thoughts, concerns, feedback and suggestions. It&#39;s your club and it&#39;s up to the Committee to do the best we can for the membership.</p>

  <h2>Hut Sub-Committee</h2>
  <p>The Hut-Sub Committee is always looking for keen volunteers to help with ideas, marketing and general maintenance. Please contact Mike, in the first instance, if you&#39;d like to be involved.<p>
  <p>All going well, and thanks to the continued hard work and commitment of the Hut Sub-Committee, the hut will be finished in 2017&mdash;just in time for the club&#39;s 50th anniversary.</p>
  <p>There will be two &lsquo;Hut Maintenance&rsquo; weekends booked in for 2017, one near the start of the season and one near the end. Please keep an eye on the website, forum, Facebook and future Bulletins for details.</p>

  <h2>Subs/Membership Fees</h2>
  <p>2017 fees are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Regular Members</b> &pound;30.00</li>
    <li><b>Life Members</b> &pound;13.25</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For those who have not already renewed, you can pay Graham by cash or cheque at a pub meet, by bank transfer (contact <a href="mailto:treasurer@brmc-adventure.org.uk">Graham for bank details</a>) or can post a cheque to Paul (<a href="mailto:secretary@brmc-adventure.org.uk">please e-mail for postal address</a>). Please make cheques payable to &lsquo;BRMC&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>17 members have already paid. It would be great if all renewals could be paid up by the end of January, in time for the first BMC return.</p>

  <h2>Contact Details</h2>
  <p>The Club Secretary, keeps a database of postal and e-mail addresses. If you do move house or change e-mail address, please remember to <a href="mailto:secretary@brmc-adventure.org.uk">e-mail Paul</a> with these changes so your details can be updated. This is especially important so we can ensure that everyone receives Club updates, membership cards, Summit magazine and their invites to the 50th summer BBQ celebration at the hut.</p>

  <h2>Communication</h2>
  <p>Feedback from members generally and at the AGM is that communication is challenging within the Club, despite all the avenues of communication available to us nowadays. This is one of the reasons for bringing back the Bulletin. Some members only receive e-mail, some are on e-mail and the forum and some all three, or a selection of the above.</p>
  <p>Can we encourage everyone to register on the forum (which may have an overhaul in 2017) and ask that everything that is arranged is posted on both the forum and Facebook to ensure that it reaches as much of the membership as possible. Nigel&#39;s Facebook post on 29 December was the perfect example of this&mdash;thanks Nigel!</p>
  <p>If you would like the Committee to e-mail out any information or include it in the newsletter, let us know!</p>

  <h2>50th Celebrations</h2>
  <p>It is the Club&#39;s 50th anniversary in 2017. At the AGM we asked for ideas of &lsquo;50 things for 50 years&rsquo; and had some great suggestions. If you have any other ideas, please let us know!</p>

  <h2>Feedback and Future Newsletters</h2>
  <p>January&#39;s Bulletin has ended up longer than expected, but there was a lot to cover. In future we&#39;ll try and keep them brief, summarising:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hut Meets</li>
    <li>Pub Meets</li>
    <li>Wall Calls</li>
    <li>Committee Meet</li>
    <li>Any other relevant/useful information, news and updates</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Feedback on the Bulletin and submissions for future Bulletins (ski meets, birthdays, weddings, training) <em>etc</em>., should be <a href="mailto:vice-chair@brmc-adventure.org.uk">sent to Kim</a>.</p>

  <h2>And Finally</h2>
  <p>A HUGE thank you to Phil, Sue, Graham and Karen for the 2016 Christmas Meal at the Hut. It was a huge success and we have been asked to thank you, on behalf of the membership, for all your hard work, cooking and for making it happen.</p>
